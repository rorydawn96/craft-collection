## About the Collection

This collection include 16 images of various crafts created by me and my family members. Crafting has been a hobby and tradition in my family for as long as I can remember- and probably much longer than that given the oldest object in this collection was created in 1978. Our newest endeavor has been chrocheting and knitting while cross-stitch has been a constant for many years. My intention when compiling the objects for this collection was to preserve some of our favorite pieces; not everyone in my family uses social media so having a website that can be shared easily will make these memories much more accessible for loved ones near and far.

While this is primarily for personal use if you feel inspired by what you see please feel free to reach out to me at rorydawn96@gmail.com and I will try to pass along any pattern information we still have.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
